example-repo
============

A repository used to demonstrate the basics of Git.

Please note that this repository was made for an introduction to git,
and therefore likely does not have much interesting stuff going on.

However, I would recommend that you go check out the cowsay repository,
because if there's one thing everyone needs more of in their lives it 
is ASCII cows.
